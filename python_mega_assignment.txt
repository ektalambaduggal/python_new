Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Python is called a general-purpose programming language because it is not specialized for any specific problems
and can be used to create a variety of different programs. 

Python is called high-level programming language because it is easy for humans to write and read python code. It is English like language.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python is called a dynamically types language because the data type of a variable is determined only during runtime.

Also, it is a strongly typed language means that variables do have a type that we do not mention while declaration but the data type matters while performing operations on variables.
 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans: Pros:
       1.Beginner friendly 
       2.General purpose
       3.Larger community support
       4.Quick prototyping as python programs are not compiled
       5.Portability as python programs are not compiled 
       6.Automatic memory allocation, developers need not to worry about 
         Assigning free space in memory
       7.Open source and free to use
     Cons:
	1.not fast because it is dynamically typed and interpreted language 
       So run time compiler has a lot of work.
	2.Memory intensive
	3.Harder to avoid run time errors
	4.not optimised for database access
	5.Prone to overuse or misuse due to ease

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans:   1. Data Science
	 2. AI and machine learning
	 3. Automation
	 4. application development
	 5. console applications
	 6. desktop Gui
	 7. audio/video apps
	 
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are the names given to specific memory locations.
     e.g.: a = 5

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: By using input () function.
     e.g.: a=input (“Enter the age”)


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input () function?
Ans: string


Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Converting the datatype of a variable is called type casting.	
     e.g.: while taking input for age using input () function, by default 
          the datatype is string but later we will not be able to do 
          certain numeric operations on it, so we need to type cast.
          Age = int (input (“Enter the age”))

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input () function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: Yes, we can but we have to use split () function with input () function
e.g.: # taking two inputs at a time
x, y = input ("Enter two values: "). split ()
print ("Number of boys: ", x)
print ("Number of girls: ", y)


Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: These are the reserved words having specific meaning and purpose, and can be used for that specific purpose only.
e.g.: int

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No, we cannot as keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of python language.

Q12. What is indentation? What is the use of indentation in Python?
Ans: Indentation is the spaces at the beginning of a code line. In some languages it is just for code readability but in python it also indicates a block of code.
 
Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: We can use print () function
      e.g.: print (“enter the age”)

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed on the operands (the values).

Four types of operators we have:
1. Arithmetic (+ - * / // ** %
2. Assignment (=)
3. Comparison (<,>, ==, <=,>=, !=)
4. Logical (and, or, not)

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: / = float division
     // = integer division



Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: str_var = 'iNeuron'
str_var = str_var * 4
print(str_var)


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans: number = int(input("enter a number")) #taking an input from user, typecast 
if number%2 == 0 :                    #checking if the number is divisible by 2
    print("it is an even number")
else :
    print("it is an odd number")


Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans; Logical operators are also called Boolean operators as they return Boolean values – True or False

There are 3 boolean operators:
1. And = will return True if both the conditions are true
2. Or = will return True if either one or both the conditions are true
3. Not= will reverse the result



Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
Ans: a =1 or 0           # will return 1

b = 0 and 0         # will return 0

c = True and False and True # will return False

d = 1 or 0 or 0             # will return 1


```


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans: These are the statements that handle conditions in programs, and guide the program to take decisions based on conditions.
For e.g.: if a > 10:
           Print(“Hello”)
         Else:
           Print(“bye”)
 
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: if is used to write condition, if that condition is true, the statements of if block will be executed.

Elif is used to write the condition means else if the condition that is written with it if true, then the statements in the block will be executed.

Else is used to define the code block that what program must do if None of the conditions is true

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans: age = int(input("enter your age"))
if age >= 18:
    print("I can Vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for i in numbers:
    if(i%2==0):
        sum=sum+i

print ("sum of even numbers in the list=", sum)



Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans: print ("enter three numbers")
a= int(input())
b= int(input())
c= int(input())

if a>b and a>c:
    print("the greatest number is ", a)
elif b>a and b>c:
    print("the greatest number is ", b)
elif c>a and c>b:
    print("the greatest number is ", c)
else:
    print("none is the only greatest")


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if(i > 150 and i<500):
        continue
    if(i > 500):
         break
    if(i%5==0):
        print(i)

Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
Ans: It is a text data type. we can give one character alphabet or number or special symbols and can even give a line of alphabets or numbers or special symbols.

declaration:
 str1 = '123'
 or 
 str2 = " this is ekta's"

Q27. How can we access the string using its index?
Ans: lets say we have a string
     str1 = "EKTA"
     and i want to access the 3rd element i.e. T
     so, print(str1[2])

Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following

string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "iNeuron"
Ans: print(string[9: ])

Ans: print(string[-1:-8:-1])

Q30. Resverse the string given in the above question.
Ans: print(string[-1: :-1])

Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?
Ans: Python will not allow deleting a particular character in a string. Whereas you can remove the entire string variable using the del command.
i.e. del string_variable_name

Q32. What is escape sequence?
Ans: Escape sequences allow you to insert special characters in strings. Put a backslash (\) before the character you want to escape.
An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that, when used inside a character or string, does not represent itself but is converted into another character or series of characters that may be difficult or impossible to express directly, like newline (\n), tab (\t), and so on.

Q33. How can you print the below string?

'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
Ans:print("iNeuron's Big Data Course")
print('iNeuron\'s Big Data Course')

Q34. What is a list in Python?
Ans: List is a collection(sequential) data structure that can contain heterogeneous kind of data( int, float or any other list as well as its elements). Elements are stored at contiguous memory locations.
e.g.: list1 =[ 1,2, 's', 5.6, 'ekta', [1,2,3] ]


Q35. How can you create a list in Python?
Ans:  list1 =[ 1,2, 's', 5.6, 'ekta', [1,2,3] ]

Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?
Ans: List is a sequential data structure so we can access elements through index values.
e.g.:  list1 =[ 1,2, 's', 5.6, 'ekta', [1,2,3] ]
      to access 2 which is at 1st index
      print(list1[1])

Q37. Write a code to access the word "iNeuron" from the given list.

lst = [1,2,3,"Hi",[45,54, "iNeuron"], "Big Data"]

print("enter the elements of list")
for i in range(0,n):
   list1.append(input())
print(len(list1))

Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.

lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
Ans: lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]
lst.insert(2,"big")
print(lst)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
Ans: Tuple is a sequential collection data type that can hold hetrogeneous data. But it is immutable unlike lists.
     once created , you can only access its elements and no changes can be made.
     

Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?
Ans: tuple1 = (20, "hi", [2,4,6], (3,4))

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: creating an empty tuple
     tuple = ()
     tuple.append("ekta")
     
     error: tuple object has no attribute append
     
     because tuples are immutable.
     
Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
Ans: You can't add elements to a tuple because of their immutable property.

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
Ans: my_tuple = tuple(input('Enter space-separated words: ').split())

print(my_tuple)
print(len(my_tuple))

Q45. What are sets in Python?
Ans: Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
     Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
     e.g.: thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
           print(thisset)
           
Q46. How can you create a set?
Ans: thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
     print(thisset)   

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
Ans: thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
thisset.add("iNeuron")
print(thisset)

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
Ans: thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
thisset.add(6)
thisset.add("hi")
print(thisset)

Q49. How is update() different from add()?
Ans:We use add() method to add single value to a set. We use update() method to add sequence values to a set.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?
Ans: The clear() method removes all elements in a set.

Q51. What is frozen set?
Ans: Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?
Ans: While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.
Ans : The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s).
You can specify as many sets you want, separated by commas.
It does not have to be a set, it can be any iterable object.
If an item is present in more than one set, the result will contain only one appearance of this item.

x = {"a", "b", "c"}
y = {"f", "d", "a"}
z = {"c", "d", "e"}

result = x.union(y, z)

print(result)

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
Ans: The intersection() method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets. Meaning: The returned set contains only items that exist in both sets, or in all sets if the comparison is done with more than two sets.

x = {"a", "b", "c"}
y = {"c", "d", "e"}
z = {"f", "g", "c"}

result = x.intersection(y, z)

print(result)

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?
Ans: Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.
Ans: The dictionary Data Structure in Python is an unordered collection of items. While other Data Structures use only one value as the element, the dictionary is a slightly more compound data structure. It makes use of two elements i.e. a pair of elements, namely, a key and a value.

Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?
Ans: thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

Q58. What will the output of the following?

var = {}
print(type(var))
Ans: <class 'dict'>

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?
Ans: thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
thisdict["made in"]= "india" 
print(thisdict)

Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.
Ans: thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict['brand'])
print(thisdict['model'])
print(thisdict['year'])
print(thisdict)

Q61. Create a nested dictionary and access all the element in the inner dictionary.
Ans: thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "color" : {'model1': 'black', 'model2':'white'}
}
print(thisdict)
print(thisdict['color']['model1'])
print(thisdict['color']['model2'])
print(thisdict['color'])
