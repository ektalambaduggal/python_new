## Assignment Part-1

Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans: Python is called a general-purpose programming language because it is not specialized for any specific problems
and can be used to create a variety of different programs. 

Python is called high-level programming language because it is easy for humans to write and read python code. It is English like language.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans: Python is called a dynamically types language because the data type of a variable is determined only during runtime.

Also, it is a strongly typed language means that variables do have a type that we do not mention while declaration but the data type matters while performing operations on variables.
 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans: Pros:
       1.Beginner friendly 
       2.General purpose
       3.Larger community support
       4.Quick prototyping as python programs are not compiled
       5.Portability as python programs are not compiled 
       6.Automatic memory allocation, developers need not to worry about 
         Assigning free space in memory
       7.Open source and free to use
     Cons:
	1.not fast because it is dynamically typed and interpreted language 
       So run time compiler has a lot of work.
	2.Memory intensive
	3.Harder to avoid run time errors
	4.not optimised for database access
	5.Prone to overuse or misuse due to ease

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans:   1. Data Science
	 2. AI and machine learning
	 3. Automation
	 4. application development
	 5. console applications
	 6. desktop Gui
	 7. audio/video apps
	 
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans: Variables are the names given to specific memory locations.
     e.g.: a = 5

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans: By using input () function.
     e.g.: a=input (“Enter the age”)


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input () function?
Ans: string


Q8. What is type casting?
Ans: Converting the datatype of a variable is called type casting.	
     e.g.: while taking input for age using input () function, by default 
          the datatype is string but later we will not be able to do 
          certain numeric operations on it, so we need to type cast.
          Age = int (input (“Enter the age”))

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input () function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans: Yes, we can but we have to use split () function with input () function
e.g.: # taking two inputs at a time
x, y = input ("Enter two values: "). split ()
print ("Number of boys: ", x)
print ("Number of girls: ", y)


Q10. What are keywords?
Ans: These are the reserved words having specific meaning and purpose, and can be used for that specific purpose only.
e.g.: int

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans: No, we cannot as keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of python language.

Q12. What is indentation? What is the use of indentation in Python?
Ans: Indentation is the spaces at the beginning of a code line. In some languages it is just for code readability but in python it also indicates a block of code.
 
Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans: We can use print () function
      e.g.: print (“enter the age”)

Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans: Operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed on the operands (the values).

Four types of operators we have:
1. Arithmetic (+ - * / // ** %
2. Assignment (=)
3. Comparison (<,>, ==, <=,>=, !=)
4. Logical (and, or, not)

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans: / = float division
     // = integer division



Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans: str_var = 'iNeuron'
str_var = str_var * 4
print(str_var)


Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans: number = int(input("enter a number")) #taking an input from user, typecast 
if number%2 == 0 :                    #checking if the number is divisible by 2
    print("it is an even number")
else :
    print("it is an odd number")


Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans; Logical operators are also called Boolean operators as they return Boolean values – True or False

There are 3 boolean operators:
1. And = will return True if both the conditions are true
2. Or = will return True if either one or both the conditions are true
3. Not= will reverse the result



Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
Ans: a =1 or 0           # will return 1

b = 0 and 0         # will return 0

c = True and False and True # will return False

d = 1 or 0 or 0             # will return 1


```


Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans: These are the statements that handle conditions in programs, and guide the program to take decisions based on conditions.
For e.g.: if a > 10:
           Print(“Hello”)
         Else:
           Print(“bye”)
 
Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans: if is used to write condition, if that condition is true, the statements of if block will be executed.

Elif is used to write the condition means else if the condition that is written with it if true, then the statements in the block will be executed.

Else is used to define the code block that what program must do if None of the conditions is true

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans: age = int(input("enter your age"))
if age >= 18:
    print("I can Vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")


Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for i in numbers:
    if(i%2==0):
        sum=sum+i

print ("sum of even numbers in the list=", sum)



Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans: print ("enter three numbers")
a= int(input())
b= int(input())
c= int(input())

if a>b and a>c:
    print("the greatest number is ", a)
elif b>a and b>c:
    print("the greatest number is ", b)
elif c>a and c>b:
    print("the greatest number is ", c)
else:
    print("none is the only greatest")


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Ans: numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if(i > 150 and i<500):
        continue
    if(i > 500):
         break
    if(i%5==0):
        print(i)
